## STAT 5474 - Introduction to Data Mining
This folder contains all of the projects submitted as coursework for this class. This class was taught by [Professor Xiaogang Su](http://www.math.utep.edu/people/dmprofile.php?username=xsu) (my thesis advisor) during the Spring 2018 semester. The course website containing the assigned projects is located [here](https://sites.google.com/site/xgsu00/home/stat5474). The university course catalog provides the following course description:
