# Graduate-School-Projects
This repository contains some of the projects that I worked on during graduate school.

## STAT 5474 - Introduction to Data Mining
This folder contains all of the projects submitted as coursework for this class. This class was taught by [Professor Xiaogang Su](http://www.math.utep.edu/people/dmprofile.php?username=xsu) (my thesis advisor) during the Spring 2018 semester. The course website containing the assigned projects is located [here](https://sites.google.com/site/xgsu00/home/stat5474). 

The university course catalog provides the following course description:

>Introduction to techniques for data mining and analytics with emphasis on R programming and hands-on experience with real data; topics covered: dimension reduction, cluster analysis, ordinary and partial least squares regression, principal components regression, ridge regression, l1-regularization, logistic regression, assessment of classifier, decision/regression trees, bagging and boosting, random forests, and data visualization techniques. 

## STAT 5494 - Statistical Data Mining
This folder will contain the projects completed for this course. I am currently taking this course (Fall 2018), and it is being taught by Professor Xiaogang Su. The course website containing the assigned projects is located [here](https://sites.google.com/site/utepstat5494).

The university course catalog provides the following course description:

>General statistical techniques for unsupervised and supervised learning, with more emphasis on methodology; topics covered: association rules, outlier detection, PageRank, parametric nonlinear regression; optimization, conventional nonparametric regression methods (including kernel smoothing/regression and smoothing and regression splines), generalized additive models (GAM), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), recursive partitioning and extensions, hierarchical mixture of experts (HME), projection pursuit regression, artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and naive Bayes classifier.
